			<h2>Quality Feed</h2>
			<p>To ensure our quality meets the expectation of our clients and contractual requirements, all our fishmeal is inspected and certified from authorities appointed locally by our company and exporters.  We have been working with third party surveyors, such as the SGS Group (the SGS Group of companies is the world leader in inspection, testing and verification), to meet GAFTA’s (the Grain and Feed Trade Association) double-certification requirement.  All consignments are guaranteed to have met the above requirement before delivery. </p>
			<p>For consignments originating in Peru or Chile, we have purpose-designated representatives to supervise the purchases, consignments and shipments.  These controls include and are not limited to the following: inspecting and analyzing fishmeal prior to shipment, rejecting damaged and unqualified cargo and replacing with qualified cargo, ensuring sanitary controls, and conducting container inspections prior to shipment.  Strict inspections are undertaken by independent inspection organizations to ensure the highest standard and that the fishmeal is pure and free from contaminants, salmonella, insects and mammal bones.</p>
